      <h1 class="articTitle">Cybersecurity and Computer Networking</h1>
      <p>When I was a student in high school, I knew that I had an interest in computer science, but I did not know what concentration I wanted to pursue in the future. As a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol, I had the opportunity to compete and lead a team in the Air Force Association's Cyberpatriot competition. The combination of technical skills required to harden operating systems and the soft skills needed to "think like the bad guy" piqued my interest. The leadership experience I gained from leading a Cyberpatriot team was also invaluable. I could teach my teammates technical skills I was interested in, further contributing to my passion for the subject area. I knew that in college, I wanted to study computer science to pursue a career in cybersecurity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In an effort to learn the hands-on technical skills required for a career in cybersecurity, I switched my major to Information Technology. I learned more about computer networking, information security, and technical writing, but I missed learning about the broader picture of low-level computer systems, computer networking, and cybersecurity research that the computer science curriculum offered. So after a year in the IT program, I switched back to the CS program and used my elective courses as a way to pursue my cybersecurity aspirations. I took courses in Information Security, Cyber Defense, and Cryptography, and upon graduation, recieved the NSA recognized NSTISSI No. 4011 Certification for Information Systems Security Professionals.</p>

          <h2>Cyber Defense and Ethical Hacking Labs</h2>
          <p>As a part of the Cyber Defense class I took at JMU, I completed many lab assignments and projects involving hands on ethical hacking and cyber defense. This project experience includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Setup penetration testing lab environment with virtual machines, performed vulnerability analysis, and created after-action pen test report document</li>
            <li>Hands-on laboratory experience using Kali Linux performing vulnerability analysis, password auditing, SQL Injection, network reconnaissance and port scanning, enumeration and mapping, cross-site scripting, and firewall and Snort IDS/IPS configuration</li>

          <h2>File Encryption Send/Receive</h2>
          <p>In this project, I developed a program that simulates a secure message send and receive process. In the first step, an asymmetric key exchange using the Needham-Schroeder Key-Exchange model occurs through a "Key Distribution Center" process. These symmetric keys are used by Amal (the sender process) and Basim (the receiver process). Using AES-256 in Cipher Block Chaining mode with a 128-bit Initialization Vector, Amal securely encrypts the file to be sent. The file is sent to Basim via pipe, where it is received and decrypted. This was a team project that was developed for my Information Security class at JMU. This project demonstrates proficiency in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Programming with the C Programming Language</li>
            <li>Using the OpenSSL Cryptography Library to encrypt and decrypt messages</li>
            <li>Confidentiality through Symmetric/Asymmetric key encryption and decryption and Integrity through Digital Signature</li>
            <li>Process creation and inter-process communication</li>
            <li>Systems Application Development</li>
          </ul>
