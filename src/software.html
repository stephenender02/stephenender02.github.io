      <h1 class="articTitle">Software Engineering and Application Development</h1>
      <p>When I was in elementary school, I dreamed about being an inventor. I started learning more about coding and software through a JavaScript animation course on Khan Academy and by toying around with Lua in Roblox Studio. I learned more about the hardware behind computers by building and troubleshooting my own PC, and I was hooked. I knew that I wanted to work with technology when I grew up, and when I learned about the subject of Computer Science, that’s where I set my sights.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through my university’s CS curriculum, I took a Software Engineering class where I learned about the software development lifecycle, working with a team of developers, working with an AGILE framework, and presenting the final iteration of our product. This class opened my eyes to the joy of collaborative development and thoughtful design before the implementation of a product, as well as how an iterative prototyping based approach to software development can tremendously aid innovation.</p>

              <p>I started using the Python programming language as a part of my Computational Analytics minor at JMU. With the NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas libraries, I learned how to write numerical analysis and operations reasearch programs with Python. Additionally, I have used Python extensively while learning algorithms and data structures.</p>

              <p>Java was the first Object Oriented programming language I ever learned, and it was the language that set the foundation for my Computer Science journey. Using Java in my introductory programming and data structures and algorithms classes, many of my first programming projects were written in Java.</p>

              <p>I learned Ruby as a part of a programming languages class at JMU, and it was the language from which I learned about how compilers work. By creating my own "spreadsheet" programming language using Ruby, I learned how to build a lexer to tokenize character strings and a parser to build the Abstract Syntax Tree that gives those tokens meaning in a programming language.</p>

          <h2>SARR Tournament Manager</h2>
          <p>As a part of the Application Development class I took at JMU, my team and I designed and developed a client side tournament manager application that allows users to create athletic tournaments, manage teams, games, and venues, and get up to date weather and bracket information. This project was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and a mix of Bootstrap and custom CSS. In the development of this project, I primarily worked on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Retrieval of tournament data from browser local storage and display of detailed information to users</li>
            <li>Display of tournament bracket with Bracketry.js library</li>
