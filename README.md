# My Personal Portfolio
This portfolio was initially designed as a school project for my Professional Development (CS-280) class at JMU. On it, you will find some information about myself, my educational background, my work experience and certifications, some of the projects I have worked on, and how I stay involved in my community.

## Other Contributors
For this project, I used a Personal Portfolio starter template called Nihory. [Here is a link to the Nihory GitHub page.](https://github.com/atulcodex/nihory-basic)
